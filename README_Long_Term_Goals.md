# MetaVida — Long-Term Goals & Roadmap

## Vision
Become a physician-educator recognized for evidence-based care with advanced biostatistics, automation, and AI—spending less time on low-value tasks.

## Pillars
- Computing → Programming → Data/Stats → Math → Teaching → AI/Automation → ML/Models.
- Publish/share reproducible work; build repeatable workflows.

## Tracks (Basic → Advanced)
- Computing: OS, files, CLI, Git, VS Code, WSL2/Docker.
- Programming: Python, R; testing, packaging, reporting.
- Biostatistics: descriptive → GLM/survival → causal inference.
- Mathematics: calculus, probability, linear algebra, optimization.
- Teaching & Slides: clear storytelling; Canva/PPT; versioned decks.
- AI Tools: ChatGPT/Gemini/Copilot, Perplexity, ChatPDF, Zotero+BBT.
- ML & Models: train/test split, cross-validation, regularization; trees; SHAP.
- Automation: Make scenarios; Gmail/Drive/Notion/Zotero glue; scripts.

## Milestones (quarters)
- Q1: Python/R L0–L1; Biostats L1; Calculus I; 2 Make automations live.
- Q2: GLM + survival basics; Probability L1; small RAG over local files.
- Q3: Mixed models & causal basics; ML starter; automate weekly reporting.
- Q4: Teach a mini-course; submit/co-author one applied analysis.

## Weekly cadence (default)
PC 15m · Programming 45–60m · Math 60–90m · Biostats 30–45m · Tools/Automation 30–45m.
Output each week: 1 commit, 1 evidence note, 1 slide improvement, 1 automation tweak.

## Deliverables (recurring)
- `biostats-notes/` Quarto site or notebooks.
- `teaching/` versioned decks with sources.
- `automations/` Make JSON exports + README.
- `ml/` notebooks with data dictionary and metrics.

## Risks & Mitigation
- Time drift → daily micro-routine + calendar blocks.
- Distraction → fixed course list; weekly review.
- Privacy → no PHI to third-party AIs; use redacted examples.
