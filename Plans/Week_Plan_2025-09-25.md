# Weekly plan (mini-steps, 3–4h/day)
## Stack decision
Hub: Notion + Make.
Google layer: Gemini Advanced.
Microsoft layer: Copilot Pro.
Search: Perplexity Pro.
Core: Zotero + Better BibTeX.
Coding: VS Code + GitHub + Copilot.

## Day 1 — House setup
Notion: create 3 databases  
Tasks {Status, Priority, Due, Project, Link, MessageID},  
Projects {Goal, Deadline, Status},  
Evidence {Source URL, Tags, Read status, Key takeaway}.  
Connect Notion ↔ Google Drive. Install Notion Calendar ↔ Google Calendar (2-way).
Gmail: create labels Action and Evidence.
Make: add connections for Gmail, Google Drive, Notion.

## Day 2 — Zotero basics
Sign in lucas.miachon. File sync ON. Download As needed.
Install Connector and Better BibTeX.
Collections: 00-Inbox, To-Read, Teaching, Research.
Save one article via Connector; check PDF; lock citekey.

## Day 3 — Assistants online
Buy/activate Gemini Advanced + Copilot Pro.
Gmail with Gemini: summarize 5 labeled threads (Action).
PowerPoint with Copilot: auto-outline 10 slides for this week’s topic. Save to OneDrive.
Canva: import deck, apply one brand style.

## Day 4 — Biostatistics + coding start
Biostats: data types, mean/median, SD, 95% CI.
Install VS Code, Python, R.
Hello scripts: hello.py, hello.R.
GitHub: private repo metavida-sandbox; first commit.
Copilot Chat: generate BMI function + quick test.

## Day 5 — Discovery pipeline
PubMed/Scholar alerts: create for 3 topics.
Feedly: add medRxiv, bioRxiv, 3 journals.
Perplexity: 2 queries “last 7 days” with citations.
Triage: move 3 items to Zotero To-Read and create 3 Evidence notes with a 2-line takeaway.

## Day 6 — Clinical reasoning + teaching
Isabel: 1 real case → capture differential and rationale into Evidence.
Build 5 more slides; export PPTX+PDF; link the files in the Project.

## Day 7 — Automate + review
Make A: Gmail label Action → Notion/Tasks (dedupe by MessageID).
Make B: Gmail label Evidence → Notion/Evidence (first URL).
Make C: Drive “Teaching Drop” → Notion/Tasks with file link.
Weekly review: clear all Inboxes, set next week’s topic and 3 goals.

## Roles of assistants
Gemini: Gmail/Drive/Docs summarization and Q&A.
Copilot Pro: PowerPoint/Word drafting for classes.
Perplexity: newest literature with citations.
ChatGPT: structured reasoning and code help.
Zotero: capture, organize, cite.
Make: glue Gmail/Drive/Calendar ↔ Notion.

## Daily micro-routine (≤20 min)
Label 3 emails → Notion Inbox sweep → add 1 Zotero item tag → write one 2-line Evidence takeaway.

## Nuggets
Etymology: statistic from German Statistik (state data). Algorithm from al-Khwārizmī.
Computing: Bit = 0/1. Byte = 8 bits. File on-demand = cloud file fetched when opened.
AI: Supervised vs unsupervised; RAG = retrieve docs then ask the model.
Biostats: CI narrows as n↑. p-value ≠ effect size. Next: linear vs logistic regression.
