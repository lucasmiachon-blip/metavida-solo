# MetaVida — Next Week Plan (3–4 h/day)

Keep the same blocks. Advance one unit per course. Add one automation.

## Focus
- Calculus Part 1 Sections 2–3; Probability Week 2.
- Python loops and files; R data wrangling.
- Biostatistics: sampling distributions.
- Make Academy Basics modules 2–4; start one API call.
- Git & GitHub: branching → PR → merge.

- 60–90m Math → alternate Calculus and Probability.
- 30–45m Biostat → next unit + practice.
- 30–45m Tools → Make module or Git topic.

## Automation goal
- Build Make: Gmail label **Action** → Notion/Tasks upsert (key = MessageID). Document steps in repo.

## Weekly review
- Push README updates to GitHub.
- Close completed Notion tasks. Set 3 goals for the following week.
