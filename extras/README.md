# Extras — Courses linking math, history, and philosophy

Beginner, video-first resources that mix **modern mathematics, calculus, probability, and biostatistics** with **history and philosophy**.

## Calculus & modern mathematics
- Introduction to Calculus — University of Sydney (Coursera).
- Paradox & Infinity — MIT (foundations: paradoxes, infinity, Cantor, Gödel).
- Calculus Made Clear — The Great Courses (M. Starbird).
- Introduction to Mathematical Thinking — Stanford (K. Devlin).

## Probability (history + philosophy)
- Harvard Statistics 110: Probability — full YouTube course + notes.
- HarvardX / Harvard Online: Introduction to Probability — edX/Harvard Online variants.
- Short history talk — from Pascal–Fermat to the modern era.

## Statistics / Biostatistics / Epidemiology
- History of Statistics — curated readings (Bayes, Laplace, Pearson, Fisher, Neyman).
- History of Statistics — University of Helsinki Open University.
- Epidemiology: The Basic Science of Public Health — UNC (Coursera), history in Module 1.
- Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions — HarvardX (DAGs; Rubin vs Pearl context).

## Pair with short books
- The Calculus Gallery (Dunham).
- The Lady Tasting Tea (Salsburg).
- Against the Gods (Bernstein).

## Themes to notice
- Infinity and rigor: Euclid → calculus → ε–δ → measure; Cantor’s infinities.
- Probability foundations: classical, frequentist, Bayesian, decision-theoretic.
- Causality: potential outcomes vs structural causal models.
- Design before analysis: Fisher’s randomization; “lady tasting tea.”
- Public health line: Graunt → Snow → modern epi/biostats.
